This paper will examine the effectiveness and reasonability of Education in Cairo, Egypt. The topic was sparked by the infamous school strike that was reported on February 26th, 1906, which was began by a group of cairo Students who saw importance in advocating for the rights of higher education students. Points of inquiry then developed as to how often was Education or the school system in Cairo made “newsworthy,” as well as how often was it critiqued and or actually modified based on the spoken out grievances of the people. Another point of inquiry entails the influence of European powers affect on the school systems in Cairo, in how they were able to modify in a way that displease law students as well as the Medical, and Polytechnic students who later also joined the fight.

In order to examine this topic, knowledge was obtained from primarily the Egyptian Gazette as well as background sources. By running the queries which focused on student and strike for instance, I was able to understand the relative prevalence of a particular time period of the year based on how the key words such as “student” “strike” as well as “school” was found throughout the newspaper. The first query I ran was focused on  any item that contained the word school for instance. In this case 91 results were yielded throughout the years 1905 and 1906 in the Egyptian Gazette.

At first inspection 91 results led me to believe that schooling and education was a topic discussed often and thus constantly worked towards improvement. Out of the 91 results skimmed closely at a sample of 33 items which contained the word “school.” Before I decided which information was useful and which information to disregard and formed a list of criterion. If the items mentioned anything in regards to school construction, funding for schools, or the success rates of students (such as graduation rates or degrees) I kept that into consideration. On the contrary any item that contained the word school in it that did not deal directly with the essence of education was disregarded. For instance, often times, school facilities were treated as meeting locations for Church organization, or other outside clubs. Thus although it would make news that church members for instance met and executed plans, this news did not directly correspond with or answer the overall question.

Approximately, 18 items out of 33 items in total readily contained favorable information. Whereas approximately, 15 results, was somewhat related or not all related to the topic in question. For instance, items that were considered not having to do with the priority topic were items that carried the following phrases: “old school”, “attending meeting at school.” This served as a potential limitation when it came to creating the data visualization. Although it was fairly simple to pull the dates from query, with items that contained school to create a graph, it was not as easy to assure the graph’s accuracy by only pinpointing the items that were actually school related.

This was also a limitation when running other queries, such as ones that pinpointed, “strike”, or “student”. For the search of strike for instance, returned results of general strikes such as dealing with labor, or government policies, and hence could not provide insight to education strikes. In addition the word strike was also used in a different context in certain items, such as to “strike” someone’s attention, thus minimized the usefulness of certain results. Lastly, with the search of “student” often times, articles would mention, student field trips, or students that were involved in a sports game.

Another issue I ran into with the gathering data from the queries is that although , it yielded 91 results, the results, in some instances, the lengths of educational updates were rather short, and thus more details or explanations had to be induced rather than straightforwardly accessed. This was also the case with gathering information from outside sources as there few records to be found in regards to education in Egypt from 1906.

Aside from context of focused words causing issues within my searches, general editing also yielded difficulties with the finding usable information. For instance, if either, “student”, “strike” or “school” were not correctly spelled in the articles that were placed in the content folder, this may have led to exclusion of potentially valuable results. Moreover, due in part to the incompleteness of digitization of the Egyptian Gazette for 1906, information regarding schools and education were not inputted. This may affected my data visualization as it is unclear to determine whether or not education the school system updates were sporadically prevalent in one month more than another because changes were actually being installed, or the issues itself were not placed in the content folder. This sets back the answer of the question as to how often was education discussed, and whether or not it was a consistent highlighted topic in the Egyptian Gazette, as topics such as “cricket” in the Sports and Play section or, the arrival of certain goods, “Arrivages de Minet Basal.”]

Due to the lack of information extracted from the 1906 portion of the 1905-1906 content repository, I decided to search further through the microfilm files, skimming through the latter portion of 1906 for education related articles. Herein in which I stumbled upon a collection of miniature updates regard the Education Act of 1906.

Among the most prominent raised issue within the Gazette regarding the education system is that of the inclusion or exclusion of religious practices within the school curriculums. Consecutively throughout issues between April 1906 and June 1906, the Education Bill (insert file from ebsco) was argued and faltered. The Education bill essentially was written in efforts to delete religious teachings from the standardized school teachings in elementary school. While the liberal, and nonconformist citizens were strongly for this ideal, religious powers, such as Lords, and members of the Catholic/Anglican church who had a political voice disagreed. In addition the prevalence of the religion the idea of funding for public schools were reconsidered. Whereas the Education bill of 1902 establishing funding for denominational schools, the education bill of 1906 reversed these ideas and proposed for “no public funding for schools unless publicly ran.” (1906-03-25). Often times schools that incorporated religious practices were voluntary and deemed to be paid for by the british government allocated funds, who wanted to induce this religious teaching.

A strength of the results yielded from the search of “school” “student”, and “strike” was that although each time there was not necessarily a yielding of completely relevant data, certain items provided a glimpse of perimeter issues in Egypt that may affect certain aspects of education in Egypt. For instance, one article discussed the prevalent criminal activity amongst the jewish population in Egypt. Although, this article raised awareness of the faulty conversions from Judaism to Christianity by many Jews at the time for money, it also raise awareness of the issue that people higher in power who had the necessitated funds to run better schools were using the money for contraband, and illegal activity such as towards the continuity of prostitution.

Moreover, another article revealed that although funds were in some cases allocated towards the construction of schools, the actual curriculum itself was often religious based and incorporated the principle of social darwinism, in which learning the dominant language of egypt and also learning the dominant religion of christianity was an underlying bases of determining an excelling student from a poor student.

Another potential issue realized with the education system is the options of careers after primary education. According to the article (01-14-1905) in Egypt, after graduation students would have the option to attend Medical School, Technical School or English School, and were reckoned to pass certain examinations with strict standards towards getting to that point. According to articles, it seemed as though there were more ways to fail and less ways to be successful, as the few succeeded and great majority were held back by examinations.

issue with the education system, in Cairo Egypt during this time was the lack of resources in the “free schools”.

For instance in [1905-14-01] states that for Victoria College specifically “libraries did not exist” majority of the educational tools were presented by donors to institutions. It is interesting to note that Victoria College was originally established 1902, and thus by this time was still a fairly brand new university. It was built to develop a higher education curriculum that was less influenced by religion, (Catholic Church or Islamic Religion). Considering that this school did not take the traditional approach with trend of education at the time to endorse religion, it is probably no wonder that Victoria College began as such an underprivileged institution with scarce resources. Religion powers  would often donate to certain institutions to adapt their practices which would lead to churches being the head of state.

Social Darwinism is evident in the education system of Egypt. According to an article titled ‘English Language Skills” by helping the native peoples “egyptians” learn english, the world would essentially become a better place. To the writer of the article the egyptians native language of “arabic” is associated with ignorance, whereas english was tied to “good behavior..morality, and accessibility comprehension.” [1905-05-08]. Also references and defined lines between social classes are evident within the education system. When referring to public schools that provided free education, writers in the egyptian would refer to them as merely government schools, essentially categorizing them. Whereas, when it came to schools that either endorsed their religion or, were private schools in general, were referred to by their complete name and were often celebrated and tied to positive characteristics, such as helpful schoolmasters, and “pupils who excelled, and passed their examinations” often which would allow them to go postsecondary institutions.

Another potential issues raised with egyptian system of education would be the fact of the competitiveness and discouragement that often pressured students to either sink or swim on important standardized testing. As seen in 07-26-1905 issue students who passed examination was often announced and distinguished. Out of the 3,333 students who were candidates and taken the primary certificate exam, only, ⅓ students passed the exam. On Another occasion, when it it came to the examination one would take to get into veterinary school, the amount of students who actually passed the examination were so few that their names were mentioned in the newspaper. (1906-10-01).

Although many schools were built throughout this time period, some government schools did not have the means to maintain their schools. For instance, with a public school near the municipal palace, of alexandria, the place school was running on no revenue. Thus teachers were not getting paid at all this moved them to leave the school as whole. Without teachers students were few and far and between and thus the schools itself shut down. While officials were aiming to beautify the city, by creating a museum in this place where there school was, there was not an acknowledgement of the fact that because this public school gone away there was one less place to obtain an education for students whose family could not afford private schools.

Given the context of education systems in general, the strikes that arose of in 1906 by Law students were most likely due in part to the relatively high standards and expectations of the end results of the curriculum but yet a disparity of an actual effective curriculum throughout. This means that students were expected to perform at the top of their class, forced to learn the english and french language, as well as a religion and yet if these requirements were not met, if the consecutive classes were not passed then idealized concept of success was not obtained.

In the scope of the time period of Alexandria, the education system in Alexandria would be considered ineffective due to its many aforementioned encountered issues. Moreover, the items of improvement listed in the Egyptian Gazette seem to not correlate with the single thing that the system puts emphasis on which is examinations for primary schooling and post-secondary schooling, as well filling the criterion to earn jobs that were posted in the newspaper. Rather it seems that specks of social darwinism seeped into the system causing educational failure and political discourse.

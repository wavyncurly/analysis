	For my serial question, I am interested in examining the behavior of asset prices in the local financial market. I entered this class with the prior knowledge that there was a banking crisis in Alexandria in 1907 that is said to be driven by excessive speculation in the local real estate market on the local level, but which is said by other economic courses to have found its impetus in a global financial crisis that was caused the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. The explanation is that the excessive stress put on the financial system by numerous simultaneous insurance payouts. The implication of this explanation is that international capital markets were sufficiently integrated to allow localized shocks to affect to spread globally. But was this the case? And if so, just how integrated were these capital markets in the age before the instantaneous flows of digital information that are said to be the justification for assumptions of perfect capital mobility. To attempt to quantitatively answer this question, I will draw upon the theories of interest rate parity. I will provide a longer and more thorough explanation of this in my final project, but to put it simply, it’s the idea than in a world of perfect information and capital mobility, prices for identical assets will be equal in different markets, removing the potential for arbitrage. To tie this to ideas of capital market integration, the magnitude and persistence of prices differentials would suggest the degree and speed to which various international financial markets react to one another.
	To accomplish this, I hope to pull price information for a particular asset over the course of the year, and compare it the prices for the same asset in the markets in both New York and London. I will then analyze and attempt to draw conclusions from the resulting data.

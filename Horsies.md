 #Who is the Fastest Horse in Alexandria#
For my serial question for this course, I would like to find out who the fastest horse in all of Alexandria during the year of nineteen-hundred and five. The topic sparked my interest while I was coding the XML for my page threes. I am fascinated by sports and I noticed that there were reoccurring articles regarding horse racing and bets taking place around the races.
The manner in which I plan to go about doing my analysis for my final project is querying the entirety of the Gazette for keywords like "horse" and "race" and "odds". This will help me find what I am looking for in order to compile data to see who the most victorious race horse was. It would be very interesting to find the Secretariat of the early twentieth century.
##Queries##
I will be using various queries listed on the how to tab on the Digital Egyptian Gazette website like listing all the “divs” by using the query: //div; listing all of the item-type “divs” by using the query: //div[@type=”item”]; listing all the item-type “divs” in your file containing specific words by using the query: //div[@type=”item”[contains(.,’word’)]; finding all tagged names of people by using the query: //persName; and finding all tagged names of places by using the query: //placeName.
##Procedure##
My plan for accumulating my findings into a report will be consisted of the following steps. I will use the various queries listed above to find the information that I am looking for. First, I will attempt to find articles of text related to races, then use the keyword stakes, then horses to gather everything that I need to do my analysis. The way I will be judging just who the fastest horse in Alexandria is, will be by finding all of the races that went on during the year of 1905, identifying the names of the race horses, and tallying the number of wins (first place), places (second place), and shows (third place) of each horse. After I have done this, I will organize my data into a histogram using a template from Google Charts. 
##Data and Analysis##
At first, I did some research on horse racing and the gambling that goes along with the sport and I found that I did not find very useful information. For the most part, I discovered facts and figures that I was already familiar with. On the contrary, when I was querying the content folder of the Digital Egyptian Gazette for material related to my serial question, using the query //div [@n=”3”//p [contains (.,’stakes), I came across the term, “furlong”, which I have never heard of before. According to LaurelPark.com, a furlong is equivalent to one-eighth of a mile, or six-hundred and sixty feet. Ergo, a stake that is twelve furlongs, would be a race that is a mile and a half long.
##Issues with the Project##
###Microfilm is a “Macro-Flop”###

-Outdated software  Poor image quality  more work/time consuming
-I suppose that this was the only way that we could begin the process in the first place….
###AABBY’s OCR Program Reads Text Almost as well as Stevie Wonder###
-Poor character recognition  many errors  time
-Spellcheck program was not user friendly
###Oxygen is a Horrendous Program###
I believe Oxygen to not be efficient at all for converting text to XML and a very inconvenient program overall. Inserting the text into the program took some much unneeded effort. Whenever I would drag the document over from GitHub to Oxygen, it would either place many arbitrary paragraph marking elements or not add any elements at all to the text.
Also, much like the spellcheck in AABBY, the interface is not user friendly. I could not save my finished work to my desktop, which is a substantial problem given that it was possible for me to lose all of my progress if my trail license were to expire, so I was forced to copy and paste the text into GitHub, which saved all of my work from being banished to oblivion. Although we were given some quite thorough instructions for Oxygen, the program itself is just simply not easy to use.
To add to the latter, many issues are incomplete and are not formatted correctly into XML. This is an understandable problem due to the aforementioned points.
